The event raises money for Shands Hospital for Children, your local Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network Hospital, in Gainesville, FL. Our contributions are used where they are needed the most, including, but not limitied to, purchasing life-saving medial equipment, funding pediatric research, and purchasing diversionary activities for the kids.";
