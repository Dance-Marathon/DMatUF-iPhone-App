iPhone App For [Dance Marathon at the University of Florida](http://floridadm.org)

This was my first attempt at making an iPhone app. Originally I intended to outsource this project, however the developer fell through and I had to do it myself. As a result, it was rushed, but still a great learning experience. It was used by participants during the 2013 Dance Marathon at UF to stay up to date on what was going on throughout the 26.2 event.
